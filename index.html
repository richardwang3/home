		<p>Bitcoin, originally created as a peer to peer network for sending money on the blockchain by a secretive Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It uses a blockchain which is stored on millions of nodes across the world. This insures the security and legitimancy of all transactions and avoid the potential censorship of money transfer. The blocks in the blockchain are processed by computers called miners which "mine" bitcoin and is the sole inflationary process of BTC. </p>

		<h2>Bitcoin: A P2P Transaction System</h2>
		<p>It is a peer to peer cash transfer system on the blockchain. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is a form of digital money that is anonymous that is encrypted. It allows anyone to send money to anyone across the world in minutes, with no censorship or dollar amount cap. This means that anyone could send an infinite amount of money across the world that no one can stop from happening. How does this work? It is all processed on the blockchain.</p>
		<p>So what is a blockchain? A blockchain is a ledger, basically a long document that stores all the past transaction history on a computer. Transactions are processed using "blocks", basically chunks of transactions that are thrown together. These blocks are added to the ever expanding blockchain. What makes Bitcoin special is that no one person can ever control it, stop its transactions, or seize someones assets. It is decentralized.</p>

		<h3>Why is It Different Than Normal Money?</h3>
		<p>Normal fiat (issued by central banks) currencies are issued by and controlled by a government or central bank. Bitcoin is different because it is decentralized, meaning it does not have a country or central bank that is issuing it. This has a variety of benefits including controlled inflation, meaning that the government could not devalue the currency at a very fast pace making your money worthless.</p>
		<p>Bitcoin does not have a central issuing power, it is completely devoid from influences that the dollar is subject to such as interest rate cuts, stock market movements, and other influences in the financial world. It is truly a decentralized currency for the people. Bitcoin transactions can never be stopped or censored, permissionless and borderless, and do not require an ID to use. They are also online 24/7, taking no holidays or weekends unlike banks. The Bitcoin network will never go down as long as one of the millions of ledgers around the world exist. This system is resistant to the test of time and will never need external influence to survive.</p>
