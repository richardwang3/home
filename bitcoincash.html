		<h1>Why Bitcoin isn't a Good Currency</h1>
		<p>Bitcoin was originally conceived as a cash alternative, it has not worked well as such. Bitcoin is more expensive, slower, and much more painful to use as a currency. It's decentralization also makes some things worse, it does not have the confidence of transaction like today's traditional payment processors like VISA.</p>

		<p>Although cryptocurrencies allow anyone to send millions anywhere in the world, they do have a few contraints. In the early days with very little volume on the blockchain, transactions were cheap and fast. Since the rise of price has driven much more transactional volume and caused the block processing times to increase from a few minutes to a few hours, and miners fees increased drastically. For example if you were to buy lunch with bitcoin, you would need to pay before you eat to allow the transaction to send, and if the price were to change you might need to send more. This alone destroys the use of cryptocurrencies as a day to day payment method.</p>
		<p>Another key issue is the volatile nature of this asset class. Most companies would not want their money to fluctuate by 30% daily and mostly liquidate their crypto upon purchase. If companies instanly sell their bitcin to cash anyway, what is the point of even buying crypto to spend? This is why I don't believe bitcoin is an effective cash alternative in its current state.</p>

		<h2>Big Issues with Transaction Speed</h2>
		<p>Bitcoin was made to process blocks of data which contain transactions, but these blocks are limited to 8MB in size. This puts a hard cap on the number of transactions per second, which is currently around 10. In comparison, VISA has a transaction speed of approximately 4000 transactions per second which is much much more than Bitcoin's transaction speed and the VISA system can be upgraded when technology advances. This hard cap on processing speed on blocks causes a severe increase in transaction times when the network is very busy. Transactions per second (TPS) is one of the most important indicators of a payment processing system's effectiveness and widespread adoption.</p>
		<h3>Bitcoin Transaction Fees</h3>
		<p>Bitcoin transactions are processed by mines, which are computers that process each block. Miners are rewarded by block rewards,(Releases a certain amount of bitcoin per block mined) and fees. Fees per transaction was very low in the early days of bitcoin, with transactions being virtually free. As bitcoin's price increased, so did the volume on the network. One way users sped up transactions was by paying extra fees, a premium to move their transaction to the front of the processing lineup. As more and more people began paying more fees, the amount of money needed to make a transaction in a reasonable time has gradually increased over time.</p>
